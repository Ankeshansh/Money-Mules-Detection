# Money Mule Detection

This repository contains the **Convolve Epoch 2 Submission**, where we implement **classification models** for money mules detection using **machine learning and deep learning** techniques. The project applies **feature selection, dimensionality reduction, ensemble learning, and neural networks** to optimize accuracy.

## ðŸš€ Features  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into the dataset structure and distribution.  
- **Feature Selection**: Implemented **Mutual Information** and **PCA** to extract the most relevant features.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Applied standardization, encoding, and class balancing (SMOTE & Undersampling).  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trained **XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN** classifiers.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Built a **Keras-based neural network** for classification.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Used **ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, and Confusion Matrices** for analysis.
